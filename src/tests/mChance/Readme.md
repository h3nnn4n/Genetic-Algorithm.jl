#### Impact of mutation chance on solving 3cnf-sat

The instance _uf20-01.cnf_ from _uf20-91_ was used as a benchmark problem and for each mutation chance (mChance)
the problem was solved 500 times with a population of size 25 and a crossover chance of 95%. The mChance variable
went from 0.01 to 0.2 with an increment of 0.001. In total the same instance was solved 10000 times.
